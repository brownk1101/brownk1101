## Hi there, I'm Karen ðŸ‘‹





- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my associates degree in computer programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Python, Java, Intro to AI, and Intro to databases
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python Projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Java Projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about healthcare related programming, I am a nurse already
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through github
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been a postpartum nurse for almost 9 years. I have decided to get into programming because bedside nursing is getting toxic and I do not wish to teach. I am not sure if I want to do healthcare informatics or using my programming degree for something else entirely.
