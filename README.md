## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**brownk1101/brownk1101** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my associates degree in computer programming
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Python, Java, Intro to AI, and Intro to databases
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python Projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Java Projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about healthcare related programming, I am a nurse already
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: through github
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been a postpartum nurse for almost 9 years. I have decided to get into programming because bedside nursing is getting toxic and I do not wish to teach. I am not sure if I want to do healthcare informatics or using my programming degree for something else entirely.
